# #Task 
# The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN,  and . Add code to print three lines where:
# The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
# The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
# The third line contains the product of the two numbers.
# Example 
 

# Print the following:
# 8
# -2
# 15

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # if name == 'something' : print("something") else: print("nothing")
    # only prints out if the file name is '__main__' (True), otherwise it is False
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
      
    print('{0} \n{1} \n{2}'.format((a + b), (a - b), (a * b)))


    # Python format() function has been introduced for handling complex string formatting more efficiently. This method of the built-in string class 
    # provides functionality for complex variable substitutions and value formatting. This new formatting technique is regarded as more elegant. The 
    # general syntax of format() method is string.format(var1, var2,â€¦)

#     # using format option in a simple string
# print("{}, A computer science portal for geeks."
#       .format("GeeksforGeeks"))
 
# # using format option for a
# # value stored in a variable
# str = "This article is written in {}"
# print(str.format("Python"))
 
# # formatting a string using a numeric constant
# print("Hello, I am {} years old !".format(18))

# Division Operators:
# Task 
# The provided code stub reads two integers,  and , from STDIN.
# Add logic to print two lines. The first line should contain the result of integer division,  // . 
# The second line should contain the result of float division,  / .
# No rounding or formatting is necessary.
